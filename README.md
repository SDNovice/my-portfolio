## Description

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I have designed this website in order to not 
only store but to also link my past projects for future employers to see! In my
header I provided a profile picture of me for refrence and my name. This site so
far is broken up into 3 sections all of which can be found in my nav. The first
section is a brief paragraph about me, my intrest, and goals! The second is my
work and projects. As of right now I have a couple place holders for future 
projects! Finally the last section is my contact information! Each section is 
linked to my navagation bar! My page is also responsive if anyone chooses to view 
this on a mobile device!

## Usage

Here is the link! ----> https://sdnovice.github.io/my-portfolio/

It actually is really quite easy to use. To view a section just click the name of
the desire one in the navagation bar and it will scroll you to there! If you are
choosing to view any of my previous work just click the image or its label and it
will deploy that application. If you wish to see my design for my other screen sizes
just access the console (ctrl + I or Command + I depending on your OS) and continue
to size it up or down!
